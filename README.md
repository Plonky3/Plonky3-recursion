# Plonky3-recursion
Plonky3 native support for uni-stark recursion.

## Production Use

This codebase is under active development and hasn't been audited yet. As such, we do not recommend its use in any
production software.

## Documentation

Documentation is still incomplete and will be improved over time.
You can go through the [Plonky3 recursion book](https://Plonky3.github.io/Plonky3-recursion/)
for a walkthrough of the recursion approach.

## Modular circuit builder & runtime policy

The `CircuitBuilder<F>` uses a runtime policy to control which non-primitive operations (MMCS, FRI, etc.) are allowed. Primitive ops like `Const`, `Public`, `Add` are always available.

By default, all non-primitive ops are disabled with `DefaultProfile`.
Define a custom policy to enable them, or use `AllowAllProfile` to activate them all.

Trying to access an op not supported by the selected policy in the circuit builder will result in a runtime error.
