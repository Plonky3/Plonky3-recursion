# Plonky3 recursion book

This book introduces the **Plonky3 recursion** stack, a [Polygon Labs](https://polygon.technology/) project, aimed at providing sufficient modularity and flexibility for developers, while maintaining high efficiency through its fixed recursive verifier design.

The material is organized to help potential contributors and users understand the motivation, construction and extensions of the recursive verifier.
