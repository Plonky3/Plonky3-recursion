/// Trait for performing Fiat-Shamir transformations within a circuit.
///
/// This trait provides an interface for implementing the Fiat-Shamir heuristic
/// in recursive verification circuits. Implementations maintain an internal sponge
/// state as circuit targets and provide methods to observe values and sample challenges.
///
/// # Design
/// The trait follows the duplex sponge construction pattern:
/// - **Observe**: Absorb field elements into the sponge state
/// - **Sample**: Squeeze field elements from the sponge state as challenges
pub trait RecursiveChallenger<F: Field> {
    /// Observe a single field element in the Fiat-Shamir transcript.
    ///
    /// Absorbs the value into the internal sponge state. The value will influence
    /// all future challenge samples.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `circuit`: Circuit builder for creating operations
    /// - `value`: The target to observe
    fn observe(&mut self, circuit: &mut CircuitBuilder<F>, value: Target);

    /// Observe multiple field elements in the Fiat-Shamir transcript.
    ///
    /// This is equivalent to calling `observe()` for each element in order.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `circuit`: Circuit builder for creating operations
    /// - `values`: Slice of targets to observe
    fn observe_slice(&mut self, circuit: &mut CircuitBuilder<F>, values: &[Target]) {
        for &value in values {
            self.observe(circuit, value);
        }
    }

    /// Sample a challenge from the current sponge state.
    ///
    /// Squeezes a field element from the sponge. This challenge is deterministically
    /// derived from all previously observed values.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `circuit`: Circuit builder for creating operations
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// A target representing the sampled challenge
    fn sample(&mut self, circuit: &mut CircuitBuilder<F>) -> Target;

    /// Sample multiple challenges from the current sponge state.
    ///
    /// This is equivalent to calling `sample()` multiple times.
    ///

    /// - `circuit`: Circuit builder for creating operations
    /// - `count`: Number of challenges to sample
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// Vector of sampled challenge targets

    /// Sample a challenge and decompose it into bits.
    ///
    /// This is useful for sampling query indices in FRI or other bit-based challenges.
    /// The challenge is first sampled as a field element, then decomposed into
    /// `total_num_bits` bits (added as public inputs), and the first `num_bits`
    /// are returned.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `circuit`: Circuit builder for creating operations
    /// - `total_num_bits`: Total number of bits to decompose (typically field bit width)
    /// - `num_bits`: Number of bits to return (e.g., log of domain size)
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// Vector of the first `num_bits` bits as targets (each in {0, 1})
